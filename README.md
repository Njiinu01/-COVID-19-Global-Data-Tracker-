# -COVID-19-Global-Data-Tracker-
Project Title
COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

Objective
To collect, clean, analyze, and visualize global COVID-19 data in order to understand the spread of the pandemic over time and across countries. The project aims to produce clear insights through statistical summaries and visualizations that can be easily interpreted by policymakers, researchers, and the public.

Tools Used

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook

CSV Dataset (sample provided)

Steps Followed

Data Collection – Loaded the COVID-19 dataset from a CSV file.

Data Cleaning – Handled missing values, standardized column names, and ensured proper data types.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Generated descriptive statistics and grouped data by countries and dates.

Visualization – Created multiple charts, including:

Line chart of cases over time

Bar chart of total cases by country

Histogram of daily new cases

Scatter plot of cases vs. deaths

Insights – Summarized key patterns, such as peak periods, most affected countries, and relationships between variables.

How to Run

Install Python 3.x and Jupyter Notebook.

Install required Python libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

Open the notebook file covid_tracker.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.

Run the cells step-by-step to reproduce the analysis and charts.

Reflections
This project demonstrates the importance of proper data cleaning and visualization in understanding complex datasets like global health statistics. Even with a small sample, trends become visible, showing the value of EDA for decision-making. The approach can be extended to live datasets for real-time tracking and forecasting.
